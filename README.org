See [[pdf:~/Library/McIntosh78.pdf][McIntosh78]] for details on the construction of B matrix
- in turn it refers to /Molecular Vibrations/, which has been sitting on the floor
  behind me the whole time I was beating my head against the fortran version...

also see [[https://github.com/psi4/psi3/blob/master/src/bin/intder/README][nate's readme]] from trying to convert it to C++

I think B does only depend on the simple internals

B relates the simple internals to the Cartesian coordinates

I want to solve for the change in the Cartesian coordinates that gives the final
symmetry internal coordinate values I want

I think this means some form of B, maybe Báµ€B or its inverse or something, will
be on the left with a solution vector X, and these two will be equal to the
final SICs or something.

BX = S

for X to be the final Cartesians (for water) it will be 9x1, which means B has
to be Nx9.
