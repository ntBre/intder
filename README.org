* B Matrix and s vectors
  See [[pdf:~/Library/McIntosh78.pdf][McIntosh78]] for details on the construction of B matrix
  - in turn it refers to /Molecular Vibrations/, which has been sitting on the floor
    behind me the whole time I was beating my head against the fortran version...

  also see [[https://github.com/psi4/psi3/blob/master/src/bin/intder/README][nate's readme]] from trying to convert it to C++

  I think B does only depend on the simple internals

  B relates the simple internals to the Cartesian coordinates

  This was true, but BS is B converted to symmetry-internal coordinates, and that
  is what is actually used later

  see comments on a_matrix for expression, something like D = BBt and A = BtD-1

  compute A, multiply by the difference between SIC_desired and SIC_current and
  add that step to the Cartesian coordinates

* Timing
  fairer comparison to DEBUG=true version since that writes something like
  intder.out

  ouch, mine takes longer with 8.8M vs 14.9M lines printed
